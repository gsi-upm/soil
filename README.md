# [SOIL](https://github.com/gsi-upm/soil)

Soil is an extensible and user-friendly Agent-based Social Simulator for Social Networks.
Learn how to run your own simulations with our [documentation](http://soilsim.readthedocs.io).

Follow our [tutorial](examples/tutorial/soil_tutorial.ipynb) to develop your own agent models.

## Mesa compatibility

Soil is in the process of becoming fully compatible with MESA.
As of this writing, 

This is a non-exhaustive list of tasks to achieve compatibility:

* Environments.agents and mesa.Agent.agents are not the same. env is a property, and it only takes into account network and environment agents. Might rename environment_agents to other_agents or sth like that
- [ ] Integrate `soil.Simulation` with mesa's runners:
  - [ ] `soil.Simulation` could mimic/become a `mesa.batchrunner`
- [ ] Integrate `soil.Environment` with `mesa.Model`:
  - [x] `Soil.Environment` inherits from `mesa.Model`
  - [x] `Soil.Environment` includes a Mesa-like Scheduler (see the `soil.time` module.
- [ ] Integrate `soil.Agent` with `mesa.Agent`:
  - [x] Rename agent.id to unique_id?
  - [x] mesa agents can be used in soil simulations (see `examples/mesa`)
- [ ] Document the new APIs and usage
