Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Soil is through pip, with Python >= 3.4:

.. code:: bash

   pip install soil


Now test that it worked by running the command line tool

.. code:: bash

   soil --help

   #or

   python -m soil --help

Or, if you're using using soil programmatically:

.. code:: python

   import soil
   print(soil.__version__)

The latest version can be installed through `GitHub <https://github.com/gsi-upm/soil>`_ or `GitLab <https://lab.gsi.upm.es/soil/soil.git>`_.
